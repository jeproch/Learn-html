        HTML elements are the fundamental components of web pages, dictating
        structure and content. From common tags like {"<div>"} and {"<p>"} to
        essential elements like {"<img>"} for images, each serves a specific
        purpose. In tutorials, mastering these elements is akin to learning the
        ABCs of web development. Beginners grasp the basics, while advanced
        developers delve into nuances, unlocking the full potential of HTML to
        create compelling websites.
